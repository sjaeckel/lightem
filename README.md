# lightem - light 'em up! a library to control RGB LED's

## Overview
lightem is a C++ library that implements a subset of the protocol defined
by [picprojects](http://picprojects.org.uk/projects/zcode/sadpktformat.htm).
It is targeted to implement a way to control addressable LED's, like e.g.
the [Adafruit Neopixels](http://www.adafruit.com/categories/168), over some
